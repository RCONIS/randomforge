# RandomForge

**Innovating the Future of Randomization**

RandomForge is an open, extensible, and collaboration-driven framework for
clinical trial randomization methods. It aims to provide a transparent,
auditable, and scientifically rigorous environment for designing, evaluating,
and applying randomization procedures — from classical concepts to modern
adaptive methodologies.

Our mission:  
To make high-quality randomization methods accessible, transparent, verifiable,
and continuously evolving — through open science, community expertise, and
industry collaboration.

## 🌍 Vision

Clinical trial randomization is a cornerstone of scientific integrity.  
However, many tools used in today’s research environment are proprietary,
opaque, difficult to extend, and not built for community-driven innovation.
RandomForge aims to change this by creating an open, modern, and shared
infrastructure where new ideas, algorithms, and workflows can be developed,
validated, compared, and applied — together.

## 🚀 Mission & Design Objectives

- **Open** — methods, discussions, and decisions should be openly accessible
- **Transparent** — every assignment must be explainable and reproducible
- **Collaborative** — built jointly by academia, industry, and the public
- **Modular** — new methods can be added without friction
- **Clinical-grade** — aligned with regulatory frameworks (e.g., 21 CFR Part 11)
- **Future-proof** — adaptable to modern & decentralized trial architectures

## 🔧 Core Features (current & planned)

- Support for classical, covariate-adaptive, and response-adaptive randomization
- Extensible method architecture (“plug-in model”)
- Clear separation of **design**, **execution**, **audit**, and **reporting**
- Role-aware usage scenarios (investigator, monitor, statistician, admin)
- Method-independent stratification & balancing frameworks
- Full audit trail capability for regulated environments
- Designed for integration with:
  - R workflows
  - Shiny applications (planned)
  - Web APIs (planned)
  - Cloud-native deployments (planned)

## 🧩 Planned Ecosystem Components

The RandomForge brand is designed to support a modular ecosystem:

| Component | Purpose | Planned Name |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Core library | Algorithms & framework | `randomforge` |
| Web & UI tooling | Shiny / Web front-end | RandomForge Studio |
| Workflow & audit layer | Governance & traceability | RandomForge Ops |
| Research & innovation hub | Method exchange & incubation | RandomForge Labs |

## 🛤 Roadmap (high-level)

1. Establish core architecture & contribution guidelines  
2. Implement foundational randomization methods  
3. Provide simulation, diagnostic & comparison modules  
4. Define audit & reporting standards  
5. Add API & UI integration layers  
6. Prepare regulatory-aware validation workflow  
7. Build community and steering group  

*The roadmap is intentionally flexible — community contribution is encouraged.*

# randomforge Package

Randomforge provides an extensible and transparent framework for
implementing, evaluating, and applying randomization methods for
clinical trials.

## Details

The package aims to support a broad range of classical,
covariate-adaptive, and response-adaptive techniques while enabling
reproducibility, auditability, and methodological clarity. Built as part
of the open RandomForge initiative ("Innovating the Future of
Randomization"), the package encourages community collaboration, modular
extensions, and contributions from academia, industry, and clinical
researchers.

The architecture is designed for integration into larger ecosystems,
including Shiny applications, APIs, and cloud-based workflows.

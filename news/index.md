## randomforge 0.1.0 (2025-11-19)

### Initial Public Release

This is the first publicly available version of **randomforge**,
released as an early-stage foundation for the emerging *RandomForge*
ecosystem (“Innovating the Future of Randomization”).

The 0.1.0 release focuses on establishing the architectural core and
enabling future contributions. It provides the conceptual building
blocks for a modular, transparent, and extensible framework for clinical
trial randomization.

#### Highlights

- Introduces the initial package structure and design principles.
- Establishes a clean and extensible architecture for implementing
  randomization methods.
- Provides early conceptual APIs for allocation logic, stratification
  handling, and extensible randomization modules.
- Adds foundational utilities and internal infrastructure for
  reproducibility, auditability, and method encapsulation.
- Includes a preliminary testing setup using **testthat (edition 3)**.
- Includes early documentation of the project’s vision, scope, and
  collaboration model.

#### Status

This version is intended as a **starting point for community
collaboration**. Many features are intentionally incomplete or
experimental, and the package will evolve significantly based on
feedback, discussions, and contributed methods.

Users and contributors are encouraged to participate in shaping the
ecosystem through issue reports, proposals, and method contributions.
